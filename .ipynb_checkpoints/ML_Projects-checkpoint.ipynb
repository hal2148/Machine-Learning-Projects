    "## Project 1 - Predicting Country Happiness\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I used data from the UN's [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/) to develop a model that predicted a country's average level of happiness based upon residents' respondents to survey questions about issues pertinent to their wellbeing, as well as other demographic factors. After exploring bivariate relationships and preprocessing data, I experimented with random forests, gradient boosting classifiers, support vector machines, and fully-connected neural networks in the model-building process.\n",

    "## Project 2 - Predicting COVID Infections from Chest X-Ray data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I used a dataset from this 2020 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13145) by Chowdhury et al. to develop models which could predict whether an individual had COVID-19 based upon X-Ray images of their chest. The dataset contains 15,153 labeled X-ray images in total - 3,616 of patients with COVID-19, 10,192 of patients with 'normal' health, and 1,345 of patients with pneumonia. After visualizing the data, I experimented with fully-connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning models (ResNet, VGG16, Inception), and was ultimately able to build a model which correctly classified 93.7% of held-out test data.\n",

    "## Project 3 - Predicting Overall Sentiment from Review Excerpts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I used the Stanford SST sentiment dataset to develop models which could predict the overall sentiment of a movie review based upon an excerpt of said review. The dataset consists of labeled moview reviews, each of them assigned either a 'positive' or 'negative' overall sentiment. I worked with LSTMs and Conv1D models for this project, and also experimented with the use of glove embeddings, bidirectional and stacked layers, as well as dropouts. I was ultimately able to build a model which accurately predicted 79.8% of held out test data.\n",
